Grade report for jpham8
===============================

Part 1

	(a) [10 / 10] toUpper in OpenMP
		[6 / 6] for correctness
		[2 / 2] for time comparable to serial solution
		[2 / 2] for parallel speedup

	(b) [10 / 10] toUpper in MPI
		[6 / 6] for correctness
		[2 / 2] for time comparable to serial solution
		[2 / 2] for parallel speedup

	(c) [10 / 10] toUpper in CUDA
		[6 / 6] for correctness
		[2 / 2] for time comparable to serial solution
		[2 / 2] for parallel speedup

Part 2

	(a) [5 / 5] Serial histogram
		[5 / 5] for correctness

	(b) [0 / 15] histogram in OpenMP
		[0 / 9] for correctness
		[0 / 3] for time comparable to serial solution
		[0 / 3] for parallel speedup
		-15: Your code is not correct. Consider creating a local histogram for each thread
		and then merging together histograms after each thread has finished on its chunk
		of the whole file.

	(c) [25 / 25] histogram in MPI
		[15 / 15] for correctness
		[5 / 5] for time comparable to serial solution
		[5 / 5] for parallel speedup

	(d) [15 / 25] histogram in CUDA
		[15 / 25] for correctness
		-10: You've got the right idea, but incrementing the histogram is a critical section issue.
		Consider doing the same thing as with OpenMP: use a collection of small local histograms
		and merge them together at the end.
